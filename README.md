# ECG arrhythmia classification using a 2-D convolutional neural network.

ECG arrhythmia classification using a 2-D convolutional neural network.

This is an implementation of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06812.pdf

The model was trained on MIT-BIH Arrythmia dataset. It took 60 hours to train the model on an NVIDIA Tesla GPU.
This is the link to the model's weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WaenBnWYyhiumkvfaqEcDzti4S9aEuhS 

The model can detect arrythmias of 6 types namely: 
1. Atrial premature contraction beat (APC)
2. Left bundle branch block beat (LBB)
3. Paced beat (PAB)
4. Premature ventricular contraction beat (PVC)
5. Right bundle branch block beat (RBB)
6. Ventricular escape beat (VEB)
